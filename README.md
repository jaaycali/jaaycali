- 👋 Hi, I’m @jaaycali
- 👀 I’m interested in all type of development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning by going through a full stack bootcamp to get a base understanding before moving on to bigger projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will give me an advantage while job searching and honing my skills as a developer.
